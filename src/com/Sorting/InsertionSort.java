/*
Insertion Sort: In this type of sorting algorithm, the LHS of the array is sorted first in parts and every pass.
     where, i=0 -> is the first pass (For which j iterates from 1 to array length)
            i=1 -> is the second pass (sort array till index 2)
            i=2 -> is the third pass (sort array till index 3)
            i=4 -> is the fourth pass (sort array till index 4)
   j will start from index 1 because this is how it'll compare both the values and swap their position
                                                                                                                           */
