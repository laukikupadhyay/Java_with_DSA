/*
Linked List: It is a linear data structure where the elements are not stored in contiguous memory locations and every element is a
separate object with a data part(value) and address part. The elements are linked using pointers and addresses inside the heap memory.
Each element is known as a node.

Singly Linked list: The singly linked list is a linear data structure in which each element of the list contains a pointer which points
to the next element in the list. Each element in the singly linked list is called a node. Each node has two components: data and a
pointer next which points to the next node in the list. The first node of the list is called as head, and the last node of the list is
called a tail. The last node of the list contains a pointer to the null. Each node in the list can be accessed linearly by traversing
through the list from head to tail.

We cannot directly access the list in the elements

class Node{
     int val;
     next Node;
}

Head: reference variable that points to the first node
Tail: reference variable that points to the last node
